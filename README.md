EXPLORATOTY DATA ANALYSIS OF RETAIL SALES DATASET
The goal of this project was to analyze transactional data from our retail operations to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can help us make informed business decisions.
Retail businesses thrive on understanding their customers, optimizing inventory, and maximizing sales. With this project, we aimed to answer critical questions such as:
•	What are the sales trends over time?
•	Which product categories are driving the most revenue?
•	How do customer demographics influence purchasing behavior?
•	What strategies can we implement to improve performance?"

 RECOMMENDATIONS
 1. Focus on High-Performing Product Categories
Insight: Certain product categories (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, and Beauty) contribute significantly more to total sales compared to others.
Recommendation:
Allocate more marketing resources and promotions to high-performing categories like Electronics and Clothing , which show consistently higher sales volumes and revenue.
Investigate lower-performing categories to identify potential issues (e.g., pricing, demand, or inventory challenges).
2. Target Specific Customer Demographics
Insight: Sales patterns reveal that certain demographics (e.g., specific age groups, genders) contribute disproportionately to revenue.
Recommendation:
Launch targeted marketing campaigns for males aged 30–50 and females aged 25–45 , as these groups exhibit strong purchasing behavior.
Offer personalized discounts or loyalty programs to frequent customers within these demographics.
3. Optimize Seasonal and Monthly Sales Strategies

11. Encourage Cross-Selling and Upselling
Insight: Customers purchasing multiple items or higher-priced products contribute significantly to revenue.
Recommendation:
Train sales teams to suggest complementary products during checkout (e.g., pairing Electronics with accessories).
Use algorithms to recommend upsell options (e.g., suggesting a higher-tier product when a customer views a basic model).
12. Evaluate and Adjust Inventory Levels
Insight: Certain products sell out quickly, while others remain in stock for extended periods.
Recommendation:
Use real-time inventory tracking systems to ensure popular items are always in stock.
Reduce overstocking of slow-moving items to free up capital and storage space.

DATA CLEANING OF AIRBNB NYC 2019 DATASET
The goal of this project was to clean and preprocess the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset (AB_NYC_2019.csv) to ensure its accuracy, consistency, and reliability for downstream analysis or machine learning tasks. Raw datasets often contain issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and outliers that can lead to unreliable results if not addressed systematically. By cleaning this dataset, we created a robust foundation for further exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling.

Purpose of the Project
The primary objectives of this project were:
1.	Ensure Data Integrity : Verify the accuracy and consistency of the dataset throughout the cleaning process.
2.	Handle Missing Data : Address gaps in the data by either imputing missing values or making informed decisions about how to handle them.
3.	Remove Duplicates : Eliminate duplicate records to maintain data uniqueness and avoid bias in analysis.
4.	Standardize Data Formats : Ensure uniformity in categorical and numeric data formats for accurate analysis.
5.	Detect and Handle Outliers : Identify and address extreme values that could skew analysis or model performance.
This cleaned dataset will serve as a reliable input for tasks such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), price prediction models, neighborhood clustering, or market trend analysis.
Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about Airbnb listings in New York City for the year 2019. Key attributes include:
•	Listing Details : Name, host name, neighborhood group, neighborhood, room type.
•	Geographical Information : Latitude and longitude.
•	Pricing Information : Price, minimum nights, availability.
•	Review Metrics : Number of reviews, last review date, reviews per month.
This dataset is prone to issues such as:
•	Missing values in columns like last_review and reviews_per_month.
•	Duplicate records due to repeated entries.
•	Inconsistent formatting in categorical columns (e.g., neighbourhood_group, room_type).
•	Outliers in numeric columns like price.
Methodology
Step 1: Import Libraries and Load Data
We began by importing essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing. Since we were working in Google Colab, the file was accessed from Google Drive after mounting it.
Step 2: Check for Missing Data
Missing values were identified using df.isnull().sum(). We implemented the following strategies:
•	Dropped Columns : Columns like last_review and reviews_per_month with excessive missing values were dropped.
•	Imputed Values : Missing numeric values were filled with the median of their respective columns.
Step 3: Remove Duplicate Records
Duplicate rows were identified using df.duplicated() and removed to ensure each record was unique.
Step 4: Standardize Data Formatting
To ensure consistency:
•	Categorical columns were converted to lowercase and stripped of whitespace.
•	Numeric columns were cast to appropriate data types (e.g., float64 for price, int64 for minimum_nights).
Step 5: Detect and Handle Outliers
Outliers were detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method:
•	Calculated Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile) for numeric columns.
•	Defined bounds for outliers: [Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR].
•	Filtered out rows with outlier values, particularly in the price column.
Step 6: Save the Cleaned Dataset
The cleaned dataset was saved to a new CSV file (AB_NYC_2019_cleaned.csv) for future use.
Challenges Faced
1.	Handling Missing Data : Deciding whether to drop or impute missing values required careful consideration to preserve data integrity.
2.	Outlier Detection : Extreme values in the price column (e.g., listings priced at $10,000+ per night) skewed the distribution. Filtering these outliers was crucial for meaningful analysis.
3.	Data Standardization : Ensuring consistent formatting across categorical and numeric columns was challenging but necessary for downstream tasks like modeling.
Outcome
After completing the cleaning process, the dataset was transformed into a reliable and consistent format. Key achievements include:
•	Missing Values Handled : All missing values were either imputed or appropriately dropped.
•	Duplicates Removed : Duplicate records were eliminated, ensuring data uniqueness.
•	Standardized Formatting : Categorical and numeric data were formatted consistently.
•	Outliers Addressed : Extreme values in numeric columns were filtered out to prevent skewing analysis.
•	Clean Dataset Saved : The cleaned dataset was saved as AB_NYC_2019_cleaned.csv for future use.
Applications of the Cleaned Dataset
The cleaned dataset can now be used for various purposes, including:
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Visualizing trends in pricing, availability, and neighborhood popularity.
2.	Predictive Modeling : Building models to predict listing prices based on features like location, room type, and reviews.
3.	Market Segmentation : Clustering neighborhoods based on listing characteristics.
4.	Business Insights : Identifying high-demand areas and optimal pricing strategies for hosts.
Conclusion
This project successfully transformed a raw, messy dataset into a clean and reliable resource for analysis. By addressing key challenges such as missing data, duplicates, and outliers, we ensured the dataset's integrity and usability. The cleaned dataset is now ready for further exploration and modeling, providing valuable insights into the Airbnb market in New York City.

WINE QUALITY PREDICTION
So, this project is all about predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. You know how wine experts can taste a glass of wine and tell you whether it's good or not? Well, what if we could teach a computer to do something similar, but instead of tasting, it uses data about the wine’s chemical makeup? That’s exactly what we’re doing here. So, the dataset contains a bunch of chemical properties for each wine sample, like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and more. Each of these columns represents some measurable characteristic of the wine. For example, "alcohol" tells us the alcohol content, "pH" gives us an idea of how acidic or basic the wine is, and so on.
At the end of each row, there’s a column called quality. This is what we’re trying to predict—it’s a score that represents how good the wine is, usually on a scale from 3 to 8 or something similar. The higher the number, the better the wine.
Now, the goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can take all these chemical properties as input and predict the quality score. It’s like teaching a computer to act as a wine critic, but instead of tasting the wine, it’s analyzing the numbers.

How I Approach It
1.	Understanding the Data : First, I spent some time exploring the dataset to understand what each column means and how the features relate to the target (quality). I checked for missing values, looked at the distributions of the features, and even created some visualizations like correlation matrices and pair plots. These helped me see which features might be important in predicting wine quality.
2.	Preparing the Data : Before feeding the data into any machine learning model, I had to clean and preprocess it. For example, I scaled the features because some models (like Support Vector Machines) work better when all the inputs are on a similar scale. I also split the data into training and testing sets—this way, I could train the model on one part of the data and test it on another to see how well it performs.
3.	Choosing Models : I decided to try out three different machine learning models:
•	
•	
•	complex relationships between features.
•	Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) : A simpler, linear model that works well with large datasets.
•	Support Vector Classifier (SVC) : A powerful model that can find boundaries between classes, especially when the data is not linearly separable.
4.	Training and Evaluating : After setting up the models, I trained them on the training data and evaluated their performance on the test set. I used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure how well each model did. I also looked at confusion matrices to see where the models were making mistakes.
5.	Tuning the Models : To get the best performance, I fine-tuned the Random Forest model using techniques like Grid Search. This involves testing different combinations of hyperparameters (settings that control how the model learns) to find the optimal setup. For example, I adjusted things like the number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of each tree.
6.	Final Results : In the end, the Random Forest model performed the best, but the other models were close. I also looked at which features were most important in predicting wine quality—things like alcohol content and sulphates seemed to play a big role.

What’s Next?
If I were to continue working on this project, I’d probably experiment with more advanced techniques, like ensemble methods (combining multiple models) or even deep learning. I’d also want to collect more data if possible, especially for wines with extreme quality scores (very high or very low), since those might be underrepresented in the current dataset.

Why Does This Matter?
This project isn’t just about wine—it’s about showing how machine learning can solve real-world problems. Whether it’s predicting product quality, detecting fraud, or diagnosing diseases, the same principles apply. Plus, it’s kind of fun to think about a computer “tasting” wine, right?
